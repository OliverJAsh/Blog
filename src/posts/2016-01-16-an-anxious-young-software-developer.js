    title: 'An anxious young software developer',
    body: `<p>As a young software engineer, I am cursed with a constant sense of anxiety at work.</p><p>I have strong opinions which are weakly held. The latter point is extremely significant, and makes the difference between someone who is arrogant and  someone who is open minded. If I don’t communicate that point clearly enough, I could be misunderstood.</p><p>I want to do high quality work because I care about the product I work on. When you care, you have to question things. If I communicate those questions badly, others may think I’m looking for an ego boost by being argumentative and trying to prove a point.</p><p>There stereotype of young people suggests they think they know it all. I feel like I constantly have to prove to others that I do not think like this.</p><p>Because I fear that I may be misunderstood, in meetings and team discussions I hesitate to say anything. The anxiety of being misunderstood makes me tense, and when I’m tense I can be blunt, so when I do pluck up the courage to say something, I’m at risk of sounding arrogant.</p><p>If I don’t feel relaxed amongst my team because I am anxious that they may misperceive my next spoken sentence of being egocentric or arrogant, then my anxiety means I can’t communicate properly. Bad communication will cause further misunderstanding, which makes me even more anxious, and so the cycle continues.</p><p>It’s incredibly important to feel like your team believes in you and trusts that you are working for the team, not for yourself. I don’t want to win arguments. I don’t want to prove that I am right. I much rather want to be associated with what is right, for the team and not myself.</p>`,
